For R users, DataFrame provides everything that R’s data.frame provides and much more. pandas is built on top of NumPy and is intended to integrate well within a scientific computing environment with many other 3rd party libraries.\n\n| Dimension | Name|\tDescription|\n|  :----:  | :----:  |\n| 1 |Series| 1D labeled homogeneously-typed array|\n| 2 |DataFrame |General 2D labeled, size-mutable tabular structure with potentially heterogeneously-typed column |\n\nThe best way to think about the pandas data structures is as flexible containers for lower dimensional data. For example, DataFrame is a container for Series, and Series is a container for scalars. We would like to be able to insert and remove objects from these containers in a dictionary-like fashion.\n"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd"},{"cell_type":"markdown","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"## Series\n\nSeries is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type (integers, strings, floating point numbers, Python objects, etc.). The axis labels are collectively referred to as the index. The basic method to create a Series is to call:\n\n```Python\ns = pd.Series(data, index=index)\n```\n\n### Series is a ndarray like \n\nSeries acts very similarly to a ndarray, and is a valid argument to most NumPy functions. However, operations such as slicing will also slice the index.\n```\nIn [13]: s[0]\nOut[13]: 0.4691122999071863\n\nIn [14]: s[:3]\nOut[14]: \na    0.469112\nb   -0.282863\nc   -1.509059\ndtype: float64\n\nIn [15]: s[s > s.median()]\nOut[15]: \na    0.469112\ne    1.212112\ndtype: float64\n\nIn [16]: s[[4, 3, 1]]\nOut[16]: \ne    1.212112\nd   -1.135632\nb   -0.282863\ndtype: float64\n\nIn [17]: np.exp(s)\nOut[17]: \na    1.598575\nb    0.753623\nc    0.221118\nd    0.321219\ne    3.360575\ndtype: float64\n```\n\n### Series is dict-like\n\nA Series is like a fixed-size dict in that you can get and set values by index label:\n```\nIn [21]: s['a']\nOut[21]: 0.4691122999071863\n\nIn [22]: s['e'] = 12.\n\nIn [23]: s\nOut[23]: \na     0.469112\nb    -0.282863\nc    -1.509059\nd    -1.135632\ne    12.000000\ndtype: float64\n\nIn [24]: 'e' in s\nOut[24]: True\n\nIn [25]: 'f' in s\nOut[25]: False\n```\n\n### Vectorized operations and label alignment with Series\n\nWhen working with raw NumPy arrays, looping through value-by-value is usually not necessary. The same is true when working with Series in pandas. Series can also be passed into most NumPy methods expecting an ndarray.\n```\nIn [28]: s + s\nOut[28]: \na     0.938225\nb    -0.565727\nc    -3.018117\nd    -2.271265\ne    24.000000\ndtype: float64\n\nIn [29]: s * 2\nOut[29]: \na     0.938225\nb    -0.565727\nc    -3.018117\nd    -2.271265\ne    24.000000\ndtype: float64\n\nIn [30]: np.exp(s)\nOut[30]: \na         1.598575\nb         0.753623\nc         0.221118\nd         0.321219\ne    162754.791419\ndtype: float64\n```\n"},{"cell_type":"markdown","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"## DataFrame\n\nDataFrame is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types.
