# PyTorch Note
1. Tensor.view(*shape)
      
    Returns a new tensor with the same data as the self tensor but of a different shape.
   ```python
    >>> x = torch.randn(4, 4)
    >>> x.size()
    torch.Size([4, 4])
    >>> y = x.view(16)
    >>> y.size()
    torch.Size([16])
    >>> z = x.view(-1, 8)  # the size -1 is inferred from other dimensions
    >>> z.size()
    torch.Size([2, 8])

    >>> a = torch.randn(1, 2, 3, 4)
    >>> a.size()
    torch.Size([1, 2, 3, 4])
    >>> b = a.transpose(1, 2)  # Swaps 2nd and 3rd dimension
    >>> b.size()
    torch.Size([1, 3, 2, 4])
    >>> c = a.view(1, 3, 2, 4)  # Does not change tensor layout in memory
    >>> c.size()
    torch.Size([1, 3, 2, 4])
    >>> torch.equal(b, c)
    False
   ```
